                           BUILD AND TEST INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILDING THE APP:

1. Using Android Studio (Recommended):
   - Open the BatteryMonitor project in Android Studio
   - Allow Android Studio to sync with Gradle files
   - Click the "Run" button (green triangle) in the toolbar
   - Select a connected device or emulator
   - The app will build and install automatically

2. Using Command Line:
   - Ensure Java and Android SDK are installed
   - Navigate to the BatteryMonitor directory
   - Run: ./gradlew assembleDebug
   - The APK will be generated at:
     app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   - Install using: adb install -r [path-to-apk]

TESTING THE APP:

1. VERSION NUMBER DISPLAY
   - Launch the app
   - Verify "v0.01" appears in the upper right corner of the main screen

   - Select each option and confirm the appropriate screen opens
   - Test that Up navigation works correctly from both screens

3. BATTERY MONITORING
   - Toggle the switch to enable monitoring
   - Check that a notification appears showing the battery status
   - Use ADB to simulate battery level changes:
     adb shell dumpsys battery set level 45  # Test 50% threshold
     adb shell dumpsys battery set level 35  # Test 40% threshold
     adb shell dumpsys battery set level 25  # Test 30% threshold
   - Reset with: adb shell dumpsys battery reset
