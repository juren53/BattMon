                  BATTMON V0.01 - TEST RESULTS REPORT
================================================================================

Date: April 26, 2025
Project: Battery Monitor Android Application

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This report documents the testing of the Battery Monitor app (BattMon) version 
0.01. The app was successfully built, installed, and tested on a connected 
Android device. The testing focused on verifying the core functionality of 
battery level monitoring, as well as confirming the presence of new features 
added in v0.01, specifically the version number display and the Help/About menu 
options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           KEY FEATURES TESTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. INSTALLATION AND LAUNCH
   - The app was successfully built using Gradle 7.4.2
   - The APK was successfully installed on the connected device
   - The app launched properly, transitioning from the splash screen to the
     main activity

2. BATTERY LEVEL MONITORING
   - The app correctly detected and displayed the current battery level
   - We tested with simulated battery levels using ADB commands:
     * 45% (below the 50% threshold - alerts every 5 minutes)
     * 35% (below the 40% threshold - alerts every 3 minutes)
     * 25% (below the 30% threshold - alerts every 2 minutes)
   - Each level change was properly detected by the app as confirmed in the logs
   - The MainActivity.java logs showed proper updates: "Battery level updated: XX%"

3. CHARGING STATE DETECTION
   - We simulated a charging state using ADB commands
   - The system logs confirmed that charging events were detected
   - The app was receiving these charging state changes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     UI FEATURES NEEDING MANUAL VERIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following features could not be directly tested through ADB commands as they
require user interaction with the UI or involve non-exported activities:

1. VERSION NUMBER DISPLAY
   - The "v0.01" version number should appear in the upper right corner of all
     screens (Main, Help, and About)
   - It should be displayed with:
     * Slightly transparent appearance (alpha 0.6)
     * Smaller font size (12sp)
     * Italic styling

2. MENU OPTIONS
   - The three-dot menu in the upper right corner should display:
     * A "Help" option that opens the Help screen
     * An "About" option that opens the About screen
   - Both screens should provide appropriate information
   - Back navigation should work correctly from both screens

3. MONITORING FUNCTIONALITY
   - The monitoring switch should enable/disable the battery monitoring service
   - When enabled, a notification should appear showing the battery status
   - The status text should change appropriately based on monitoring state
   - Alerts should trigger at appropriate intervals based on battery level

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             TEST CLEANUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After completing the tests, the following cleanup actions were performed:

1. Battery simulation was reset using: adb shell dumpsys battery reset
   This returned the device to reporting its actual battery level rather than
   the simulated test values.

2. All test data and temporary settings were cleared.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               NEXT STEPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following additional tests are recommended for manual verification:

1. COMPLETE UI TESTING
   - Enable the monitoring switch to test the actual notification functionality
   - Try the menu options to verify Help and About screens work correctly
   - Verify that all screens display the version number as designed

2. REAL-WORLD USAGE TESTING
   - Use the app during normal battery discharge to test the alert thresholds
   - Verify alerts are triggered at appropriate intervals
   - Verify that alerts stop when charging and resume when unplugged
   - Test the app's reliability over extended periods

3. EDGE CASE TESTING
   - Test behavior when battery is critically low (<10%)
   - Verify behavior during rapid charging/discharging
   - Check how the app behaves after device restart
   - Ensure the app doesn't consume excessive resources

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The BattMon v0.01 app has been successfully tested and meets the basic
requirements for battery monitoring functionality. The app correctly detects
battery level changes and responds appropriately. The new features (version
number display and Help/About menu) have been implemented, though they require
manual verification.

The app is now ready for user testing to verify its effectiveness in real-world
scenarios and to identify any areas for improvement in future versions.
