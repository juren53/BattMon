Battery Status Window [BSW] Ideas - My Thoughts:

1. Maintain Prominent State of Charge
✅ Excellent idea - The current 32pt percentage is good, but we could make it even more prominent or add visual enhancements like:
•  Gradient backgrounds based on charge level
•  Animated transitions
•  Maybe even larger text (36-40pt) with better typography

2. Add Battery Health
✅ Very valuable addition - This would provide crucial long-term battery insights:
•  Linux: Can read from /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/health and /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/capacity_level
•  Windows: WMI provides DesignCapacity vs FullChargeCapacity for health calculation
•  macOS: system_profiler SPPowerDataType provides health info
•  Could show: Health percentage, cycle count, design vs current capacity

3. Add Battery Activity for Last Week
✅ Fantastic feature - This would be very useful for usage pattern analysis:
•  Could track charging/discharging patterns
•  Show graphs or charts of battery usage over time
•  Maybe include metrics like: average daily usage, charging frequency, time spent in different charge ranges
•  We'd need to implement data logging/storage for this

4. Style Consistency with About Window
✅ Great point - Looking at the About window styling (lines 519-559), it uses:
•  Rich HTML formatting
•  Professional layout with clear sections
•  Consistent color scheme and typography
•  The BSW should definitely match this modern, professional look

Implementation Suggestions:

Would you like me to start implementing these enhancements? Here's what I'm thinking for the approach:

Phase 1: Enhanced UI & Battery Health
•  Redesign BSW layout to match About window styling
•  Add battery health section with platform-specific health data
•  Improve the prominence of the charge display
•  Add more detailed battery information (voltage, temperature if available)

Phase 2: Activity Tracking
•  Implement battery usage logging system
•  Create simple data visualization (maybe using Qt's built-in charting or ASCII graphs)
•  Add weekly/daily usage statistics

Phase 3: Advanced Features  
•  Historical data export
•  Usage pattern analysis
•  Battery optimization tips based on usage

Would you like me to start with Phase 1 and create an enhanced Battery Status Window with health information and improved styling? Or would you prefer to tackle a specific aspect first?
