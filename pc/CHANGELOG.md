# Changelog

All notable changes to BattMon PC will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.4] - 2025-08-13 22:35:00 CDT

### Changed - Streamlined About Dialog ðŸ“„
- **Simplified About Dialog**: Removed redundant sections from the About dialog
  - Removed "Key Advantages" section (single codebase, native look/feel, etc.)
  - Removed "Platform-Specific Features" section (Linux ACPI, Windows WMI/PowerShell, macOS pmset details)
  - Maintained core feature list and essential information (version, build date, Qt version, platform)
  - Cleaner, more focused presentation without duplicate information

### User Experience Improvements
- **Cleaner Interface**: About dialog now flows more naturally from feature list to developer information
- **Reduced Clutter**: Removed technical implementation details that were redundant with feature descriptions
- **Better Focus**: Highlights the application's capabilities without overwhelming technical specifics

## [0.5.3] - 2025-08-12 04:33:00 CDT

### Fixed - Low Battery Beep Logic and Startup Confirmation âœ…
- Beep on 1%+ drop while not charging now works reliably across state transitions (e.g., when entering Discharging exactly as a 1% drop occurs)
  - Implemented last_seen_percent tracking each tick
  - Triggers beeps when current percent is at least 1 lower than last_seen_percent
  - Orange (30â€“49%): single beep; Red (<30%): double beep
- Added clear debug logs for drop detection and charging state for easier troubleshooting
- Added a short startup beep to confirm the application initialized successfully

### Notes
- Windows still reports integer battery percentages; sub-percentage precision is not available via standard APIs.

## [0.5.2] - 2025-08-11 12:53:00 CDT

### Added - Audio Alert System ðŸ”Š
- **Cross-Platform Audio Beeps**: Synchronized audio alerts with pulsing visual animations
  - Beeps trigger when pulsing icons reach maximum opacity (peak visibility)
  - Audio feedback for low battery warnings enhances accessibility
  - Short, non-intrusive 0.1-0.15 second beeps at 800 Hz frequency
  - Automatic beep timing matches visual pulse cycles

### Platform-Specific Audio Implementation
- **Windows**: Uses built-in `winsound.Beep()` module for reliable system beeps
  - No external dependencies required
  - Native Windows audio API integration
  - 150ms beep duration at 800 Hz frequency
- **Linux/macOS**: Uses `sox` (`play` command) for high-quality audio generation
  - 0.1 second sine wave beeps at 800 Hz
  - Leverages existing sox dependency from beep timer functionality
  - Graceful fallback to silent operation if sox unavailable

### Audio Alert Behavior
- **Battery < 30%** (Critical/Red): Fast audio beeps every 300ms with pulsing
- **Battery 30-50%** (Warning/Orange): Slower audio beeps every 600ms with pulsing  
- **Battery > 50%** (Normal/Yellow-Green): No audio alerts or pulsing
- **Charging State**: Audio alerts automatically disabled regardless of battery level
- **Toggle Control**: Built-in `beep_with_pulse` flag for easy enable/disable

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Multi-Modal Alerts**: Combines visual pulsing with synchronized audio feedback
- **Accessibility Improvement**: Audio cues help users notice low battery warnings
- **Non-Intrusive Design**: Short beep duration prevents audio annoyance
- **Smart Timing**: Beeps only at pulse peaks for maximum effectiveness
- **Battery State Awareness**: Respects charging status to avoid unnecessary alerts

### Technical Improvements
- Added cross-platform `beep()` method with OS-specific implementations
- Enhanced `pulse_update()` method to trigger audio at optimal timing
- Integrated audio functionality without affecting existing pulse animation logic
- Maintained backward compatibility with all existing features
- Zero additional dependencies for Windows users

### Development Tools
- **beep_timer.py**: Cross-platform beep testing utility created during development
  - Standalone audio testing for both Linux (sox) and Windows (winsound)
  - 5-second interval beeping for audio system verification
  - Serves as reference implementation for audio functionality

### Key Benefits
- âœ… **Enhanced Accessibility**: Audio alerts complement visual notifications
- âœ… **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified beep behavior across all supported OS
- âœ… **Smart Integration**: Audio synchronized with existing pulse animations
- âœ… **Resource Efficient**: Minimal CPU usage with short beep duration
- âœ… **User Controlled**: Easy to disable via configuration flag
- âœ… **Battery Aware**: Respects charging state and battery level thresholds
