### Fixed - Windows 11 Audio Beep Issue 🔧
- **Windows System Sound Integration**: Fixed silent beeps on Windows 11 systems
  - **Root Cause**: Windows 11 often has system beeps (winsound.Beep) and MessageBeep disabled by default
  - **Solution**: Implemented Windows system WAV sound integration using winsound.PlaySound() 
  - **Primary Method**: Uses "SystemExclamation" for warning alerts and "SystemDefault" for standard alerts
  - **Fallback Chain**: WAV sounds → MessageBeep → Raw beeps → Echo beeps for maximum compatibility
  - **Cross-Platform**: Linux and macOS beep functionality remains unchanged

### Enhanced Windows Compatibility
- **Audible Startup Beep**: Windows users now hear confirmation sound when battmon initializes
- **Battery Drop Alerts**: 1%+ battery drops while discharging now produce audible alerts on Windows 11:
  - Orange zone (30-49%): Single system sound alert  
  - Red zone (0-29%): Double system sound alert
- **System Integration**: Uses Windows' native UI sound system instead of raw beep generation
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Added comprehensive Windows sound troubleshooter for future debugging

### Developer Tools Added
- **windows_sound_troubleshooter.py**: Comprehensive diagnostic tool for Windows audio issues
  - Tests multiple Windows beep methods (winsound.Beep, MessageBeep, WAV sounds, PowerShell, echo)
  - Identifies which sound methods work on specific Windows configurations
  - Provides detailed troubleshooting guidance and system settings checks
  - Automatically generates fixed beep implementations based on working methods
- **battmon_beep_test.py**: Standalone test script using the working sound method

### Technical Implementation
- **Robust Audio Stack**: Multi-tier fallback system ensures audio alerts work across different Windows configurations
- **System Sound API**: Leverages Windows' built-in system sounds for better reliability than raw beep generation
- **Backwards Compatible**: All existing Linux/macOS functionality preserved
- **Zero Dependencies**: No additional Windows audio libraries required

### User Experience
- **Reliable Audio Feedback**: Windows 11 users now get consistent audio alerts for battery events
- **System Native**: Uses familiar Windows system sounds instead of generic beeps
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Comprehensive diagnostic tools help resolve audio issues on any Windows system
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified beep behavior now works reliably across all supported platforms

### Changed - Streamlined About Dialog 📄

  - Removed "Platform-Specific Features" section (Linux ACPI, Windows WMI/PowerShell, macOS pmset details)
  - Maintained core feature list and essential information (version, build date, Qt version, platform)
  - Cleaner, more focused presentation without duplicate information

### User Experience Improvements
- **Cleaner Interface**: About dialog now flows more naturally from feature list to developer information
- **Reduced Clutter**: Removed technical implementation details that were redundant with feature descriptions
- **Better Focus**: Highlights the application's capabilities without overwhelming technical specifics

## [0.5.3] - 2025-08-12 04:33:00 CDT

### Fixed - Low Battery Beep Logic and Startup Confirmation ✅
- Beep on 1%+ drop while not charging now works reliably across state transitions (e.g., when entering Discharging exactly as a 1% drop occurs)
  - Implemented last_seen_percent tracking each tick
  - Triggers beeps when current percent is at least 1 lower than last_seen_percent
  - Orange (30–49%): single beep; Red (<30%): double beep
- Added clear debug logs for drop detection and charging state for easier troubleshooting
- Added a short startup beep to confirm the application initialized successfully

### Notes
- Windows still reports integer battery percentages; sub-percentage precision is not available via standard APIs.

## [0.5.2] - 2025-08-11 12:53:00 CDT

### Added - Audio Alert System 🔊
- **Cross-Platform Audio Beeps**: Synchronized audio alerts with pulsing visual animations
  - Beeps trigger when pulsing icons reach maximum opacity (peak visibility)
  - Audio feedback for low battery warnings enhances accessibility
  - Short, non-intrusive 0.1-0.15 second beeps at 800 Hz frequency
  - Automatic beep timing matches visual pulse cycles

### Platform-Specific Audio Implementation
- **Windows**: Uses built-in `winsound.Beep()` module for reliable system beeps
  - No external dependencies required
  - Native Windows audio API integration
  - 150ms beep duration at 800 Hz frequency
- **Linux/macOS**: Uses `sox` (`play` command) for high-quality audio generation
  - 0.1 second sine wave beeps at 800 Hz
  - Leverages existing sox dependency from beep timer functionality
  - Graceful fallback to silent operation if sox unavailable

### Audio Alert Behavior
- **Battery < 30%** (Critical/Red): Fast audio beeps every 300ms with pulsing
- **Battery 30-50%** (Warning/Orange): Slower audio beeps every 600ms with pulsing  
- **Battery > 50%** (Normal/Yellow-Green): No audio alerts or pulsing
- **Charging State**: Audio alerts automatically disabled regardless of battery level
- **Toggle Control**: Built-in `beep_with_pulse` flag for easy enable/disable

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Multi-Modal Alerts**: Combines visual pulsing with synchronized audio feedback
- **Accessibility Improvement**: Audio cues help users notice low battery warnings
- **Non-Intrusive Design**: Short beep duration prevents audio annoyance
- **Smart Timing**: Beeps only at pulse peaks for maximum effectiveness
- **Battery State Awareness**: Respects charging status to avoid unnecessary alerts

### Technical Improvements
- Added cross-platform `beep()` method with OS-specific implementations
- Enhanced `pulse_update()` method to trigger audio at optimal timing
- Integrated audio functionality without affecting existing pulse animation logic
- Maintained backward compatibility with all existing features
- Zero additional dependencies for Windows users

### Development Tools

  - Standalone audio testing for both Linux (sox) and Windows (winsound)
  - 5-second interval beeping for audio system verification
  - Serves as reference implementation for audio functionality

### Key Benefits
- ✅ **Enhanced Accessibility**: Audio alerts complement visual notifications
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified beep behavior across all supported OS
- ✅ **Smart Integration**: Audio synchronized with existing pulse animations
- ✅ **Resource Efficient**: Minimal CPU usage with short beep duration

   - Added proper string encoding handling for subprocess output
   - Fixed default value types in ConfigParser for Python 3 compatibility

2. **Enhanced Icon Design**:
   - Replaced simple battery outline with filled, color-coded design
   - Implemented rectangular battery shape with terminal for authenticity
   - Added prominent charging indicator with improved visibility
   - Optimized text positioning and sizing for different percentage ranges

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Added comprehensive right-click context menu
   - Implemented about dialog with version and timestamp information
   - Enhanced tooltip information with time remaining
   - Reduced console spam with smart notification system

4. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling
